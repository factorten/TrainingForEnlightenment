This site is a collection of notes from Dharma teachings given by teachers of the New Kadampa Tradition, of which I have attended classes, courses, and retreats for over 25 years. I am currently a student at [Kadampa Meditation Centre London](https://meditation.london).

[The New Kadampa Tradition](https://kadampa.org) is a Buddhist school whose founder is Geshe Kelsang Gyatso Rinpoche. He was born in Tibet in 1931, and became a monk at the age of 8. He was invited to teach in the West and moved to England in 1977.

Kadampa Buddhism is a Mahayana Buddhist school founded by the great Indian Buddhist Master Atisha (AD 982-1054). The Kadampa lineage passed from generation to generation until the fourteenth century when it reached the great Buddhist Master Je Tsongkhapa. After Je Tsongkhapa, the New Kadampa lineage flourished for hundreds of years, down to the present day.

By founding the New Kadampa Tradition, the International Kadampa Buddhist Union, Geshe Kelsang has created a global infrastructure to preserve and promote Kadampa Buddhism for many generations to come.

 Kadampas use Buddha's teachings as practical methods for transforming daily activities into the path to enlightenment, integrating their understanding of all Buddha's teachings into their practice of [Lamrim](https://kadampa.org/buddhism/stages-of-the-path), and by integrating their experience of Lamrim into their everyday lives.
